Box Ruby Library
----------------
### Important Notice from the Box Team###
The Box team is going to ramp down active support of this library over the next couple of months.  We suggest you take a look at a much more [current library](https://github.com/attachmentsme/ruby-box) developed by our good friends over at [attachments.me](https://attachments.me/). If you have any questions or concerns, please let us know by emailing us at api@box.com.  

### Background ###

You can use the Box.net API to create applications and websites that integrate with Box.net and can perform the following functions:

* Store and retrieve files from Box
* Organize files into folders
* Move, rename and delete files
* Share files

### Install ###

    gem install box-api

That's it!

### Usage ###

You must first obtain an API key by [registering your Box application](http://www.box.net/developers/services).

Once you have an API key, you are free to start using the box API! Check out the 'examples' folder for sample code and instructions.

### Documentation ###

You can find documentation for this gem [here](http://rubydoc.info/gems/box-api/frames).

You can find API documentation at [http://developers.box.net/](http://developers.box.net/). Full documentation regarding the Ruby library methods is coming soon.

### Support ###

If you have any questions or suggestions for improvement, ping us on our [forum](http://forum.developers.box.net/box_developers) or email us directly at developers[at]box[dot]net.
